Presentation:

Slide 1:

  Description of problem.
    Path finding. Time dependence explodes solution space. Obstacles make efficient paths difficult to find.

Slide 2:

  Introduce Graphs, micro segment on intro graph theory. Present the basic data structure for graphs (nodes, edges, loops)

Slide 3:

  Describe What else is needed to solve problem:
    1. Cost function
    2. Node to node decision making algorithm
    3. How to generate deviations
    4. Application of simulated annealing
    (perhaps have a slide on each of these)

Slide 4:

  Show results, .gif files of path iterations.

Slide 5:
  Future problems and considerations:
  
  Show a "greed trap" example
  Show a "race" between two travelers
